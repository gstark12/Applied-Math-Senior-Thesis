# Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling to Predict ADHD Diagnoses 

Determining how to best predict Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can
contribute to our understanding of its neurological basis. Previous work suggests that
both connectome-based predictive models (CPMs) and connectome-convolutional neural
networks (CCNNs) can be effective tools to predict ADHD from functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans. I used both types of models and 10-fold crossvalidation
to predict the ADHD Rating Scale IV scores of 229 subjects based on their
functional connectivity patterns measured with resting-state fMRI data. I hypothesized
that CCNNs would have stronger predictive power than CPMs, because of the formerâ€™s
ability to handle both complex patterns and sparse data. I found, however, that although
both methods predicted ADHD symptoms well, CPMs outperformed CCNNs. I also discovered
that models performed better when functional connectivity was measured with
Pearson correlation rather than with dynamic time warping distance. Moreover, there are
high average correlations between the predicted scores of models with varying input and
method types. These high correlations suggest that both input types encompass similar
information and that both method types pick up on certain common trends in the data.
Overall, these results suggest that CPMs deal with the challenges of fMRI data better
than CCNNs do.
